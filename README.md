# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Chances are if you're viewing this, it's because I directed you here or you've been snooping around my repositories- in any case, welcome! This repo is a template on how I help manage student organizations (in particular [DSC-UTRGV](https://dsc.community.dev/university-of-texas-rio-grande-valley/)) at my university. We use GitHub to keep manage tasks using an industry-standard tool and provide an opportunity for team members to ask for help/review when they're stuck. With issues, PRs, and project boards, you can easily assign tasks to team members, categorize the urgency of your assignments, and track progress of any initiatives you're actively working on (or not), all in one repo.

The most active tabs are Issues and Projects- check them out to see how to use GitHub as a management tool for your student organization! 

Have any questions, concerns, or complaints? Feel free to open a PR and I'll get to it soon.
