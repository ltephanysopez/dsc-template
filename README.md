# Hi! ðŸ‘‹âœ¨

Chances are if you're viewing this, it's because I directed you here or you've been snooping around my repositories- in any case, welcome! This repo is a template on how I help manage student organizations (in particular [DSC-UTRGV](https://dsc.community.dev/university-of-texas-rio-grande-valley/)) at my university. 


## How this works
We use GitHub to keep manage tasks using an industry-standard tool and provide an opportunity for team members to ask for help/review when they're stuck. With issues, PRs, and project boards, you can easily assign tasks to team members, categorize the urgency of your assignments, and track progress of any initiatives you're actively working on (or not), all in one repo.

The most active tabs are in this repo are Issues and Projects- issues can be used as tasks, events, or initiatives that the org is corrently working on and can be assigned to a single individual or multiple people. You can assign different labels to each issue so your tasks can be divided into different categories and project boards in the Project tab, where you can then check the progress on each issue. Check out the issues and projects tab to see how they work!
