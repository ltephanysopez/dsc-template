# Marketing 🔮✨💻
Marketing leads are how we connect with our audience- from students who want to grow as a developer to students who want to learn to code, marketing leads help spread our mission and make our events accessible to students across our university. They are the wizards of design, partnerships, and all things comms. 🧙‍♂️✨
